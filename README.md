# YearWithMostPeople
Most of my explanations and documentation can be found in comments in the code
I have included a few files that can be used to test the code. The results from running them are written to the console and are as follows:
people1.txt - The year in which the most of the given people were alive was 1950.
people2.txt - The year in which the most of the given people were alive was 1951.
people3.txt - This file is empty.
people4.txt - The contents of this file do not have the correct format.
people5.txt - Not every year was from 1900 to 2000.
people6.txt - Birth years cannot be later than end years.
people7.txt - The year in which the most of the given people were alive was 1950.
